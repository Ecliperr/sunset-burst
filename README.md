# Sunset Burst!

This is a high-contrast red, orange, black and grey theme.
Almost all elements are custom color coded for Python, Go,
and JavaScript. I'll add more customizations for more
languages in the future.

# How to Use
To activate the sunset burst theme, follow these steps:

1. Launch Visual Studio Code.
2. Open the Command Palette by pressing `Ctrl+Shift+P`.
3. Type "Preferences: Color Theme" and select it from the list.
4. In the color theme selection menu, choose "Sunset Burst".
